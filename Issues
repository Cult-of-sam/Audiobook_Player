1. Random drawings and letters etc get drawn randomly in random places if forwarding/rewinding the audio for a long time and messes up the format
   and for some reason these random drawings by ncurses is not being erased like it should be in the loop.

2. CPU usage at worst case scenario is jumping to 30%, which is because nonblocking is turned off, thus the the program is always executing some
   code in the MAIN_LOOP function. However if we turn on blocking, The program will halt to wait for user input, and thus reduce cpu usage, such
   that worst case CPU usage is 20%. The code already written has been catered for blocking IO, which is why the redrawing etc, is done at the beginning
   of the loop before waiting to get input, otherwise whatever gets written after will be cleared once the loop goes back around. I've been
   messing around with nonblocking to try and get the redrawings to work to try and fix issue .1 to no avail it seems.


3. Optimise the threads better, in terms of when to sleep and when not to sleep and for how long etc, so everything can function correctly. As I think the
   reason why issue .1 occurs is because the main program sometimes doesn't get the time to perform the redraws thanks to the timer thread, 
   but that's just a theory.
